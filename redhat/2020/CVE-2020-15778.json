{
  "mitigation": "As per upstream, because of the way scp is based on a historical protocol called rcp which relies on that style of argument passing and therefore encounters expansion problems. Making changes to how the scp command line works breaks the pattern used by scp consumers. Upstream therefore recommends the use of rsync in the place of scp for better security.",

  "statement": "This security flaw lies in the way scp command parses its command line arguments. The SSH protocol or any other applications shipped as a part of openssh-clients packages are not vulnerable.\nThis flaw has been rated as having moderate security impact because it is exploitable only when using scp client utility and the restriction bypass is limited only to cases when scp (copying of files) is allowed, but running remote commands or login to the remote server via ssh is not allowed.",
