  "description": "Perl-Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) library before 6.2 does not properly count the number of named capturing subpatterns, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a regular expression with a large number of named subpatterns, which triggers a buffer overflow.  NOTE: this issue was originally subsumed by CVE-2006-7224, but that CVE has been REJECTED and split.",
