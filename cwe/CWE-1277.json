  "The inability to patch the product's firmware means that any weaknesses therein cannot be mitigated through an update. This leaves the system/device open to potential exploitation of the inherent weaknesses present. External protective measures and mitigations can be employed to aid in preventing malicious behavior, but the root weakness cannot be corrected."
