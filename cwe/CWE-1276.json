 "ExtendedDescription": [
  "Individual hardware IP must communicate with the larger system in order for the product to function correctly and as intended. If implemented incorrectly, these various inputs and output interactions may cause security issues that will not necessarily manifest as functional bugs. For example, if the IP should only be reset by a system-wide hard reset, but instead the reset input is connected to a software-triggered debug mode reset (which is also asserted during a hard reset), integrity of data inside the IP can be violated."
