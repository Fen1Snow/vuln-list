 "ExtendedDescription": [
  "When a circuit is first brought out of reset, the state of storage elements will be unknown if not explicitly initialized by the logic. If registers holding security-critical state are not properly initialized before being used to control access to design assets or critical resources, there will be a timing window during which the device is in an insecure state and vulnerable to attack."
