 "ExtendedDescription": [
  "Security sensitive values, keys, intermediate steps of cryptographic operations, etc. are stored in temporary registers in the hardware. These values must be cleared whenever debug mode is entered. Since all internal registers can typically be accessed through the debug interface, an untrusted debugger might gain access to this sensitive data that would otherwise have been inaccessible."
