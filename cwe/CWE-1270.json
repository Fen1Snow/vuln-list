 "ExtendedDescription": [
  "Systems-On-Chip (Integrated circuits and hardware engines) implement Security Identifiers to differentiate/identify actions originated from various agents.  These actions could be ‘read’, ‘write’, ‘program’, ‘reset’, ‘fetch’, ‘compute’, etc.  Security identifiers are generated and assigned to every agent in the System (SoC) that is either capable of generating an action or receiving an action from another agent. Every agent could be assigned a unique, Security Identifier based on its trust level or privileges.  Hence the generation of the Security Identifiers is very important to achieve security in the SoC.  A common weakness that can exist is that the generated Security Identifiers are incorrect.  Consequently, the same agent may have multiple identifiers or multiple agents may have the same security identifier.  In either case, the security consequences could be a Denial-of-Service (DoS) or execution of an action that in turn could result in privilege escalation or unintended access."
